Given the scenario described above, the problem we wish to face is the management of security issues when two or more spontaneous networks merge together, and when a spontaneous network is partitioned in two or more groups of users, each one using its own network. In the case of networking established using spontaneous VPN (i.e. a VPN among nodes, built using a shared session key), the basic problem is how to manage session keys when two networks merge, in order to build a new VPN in a transparent way for users and applications, and how to have independent networks when subsets of users choose to leave the original network. To provide a full transparency also other aspects, such as naming, addressing and authentication, have to be considered.
