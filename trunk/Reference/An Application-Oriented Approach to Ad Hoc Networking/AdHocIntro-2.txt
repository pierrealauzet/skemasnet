	Defining of Spontanious Network itself.

Envrionment
MANET

Problem definition(Issue)
	1. The network must operate independently of an access point infrasturucture even in mobile.
		- address allocation, name assignment
	2. The network must operate independently of a pre-established or centralized network management 			infrastructure, while still providing administrative services needed to support application.
		- security, firewall

Proposed term.
	Spontaneous Network: the human interactions that take place in the context of such an application can be 		leveraged to create the necessary configuration infrastructure.

	Users do not need to identify all the (human and computational) participants or to administratively configure 	their computers in advance//, while they are still connected to their home network. ??

	Good applcation candidates
	ex) interactive presentation, collaborative editing, shared whiteboards, game.

	Intentionality that can be leveraged in order to create an ordered method for initializing the network 			configuration.

	Spontaneous networks have a limited extent in both space and time.

	it is expected that significant changes will be relatively infrequent compared to the lifetime of the 	network.

Goal
	Empower users to create computer networks with the same ease, flexibility and spontaneity as the human 		interactions they are intended to facilitate.

Challenges
	1. Network boundaries are poorly defined
	2. The network is not planned
	3. Hosts are not pre-configured
	4. There are no central servers.
	5. Users are not experts.

Enabling Techniques
	Automatic/Dynami configuration
	Security
	Peer-to-peer operation
