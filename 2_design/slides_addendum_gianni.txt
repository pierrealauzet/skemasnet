[Problem definition]

- We are in the case of:

        - two spontaneous networks decide to merge together or

        - a subset of users in a spontaneous network choose to create their
        own network, independent of original one,

and we wish to find a transparent and easy way to let users perfom such kind of
operation in an almost automatic way.


[Key point]

- Our main idea is to use pre-existing networks to share new keys, in order
to propagate them in an automatic and transparent way for users, without the
need to connect each other to get the new key;

- in the case of merger two users, one in each pre-established network, are
delegated to create the new key and share it with other users belonging to
their own network;

- in case of a separating network, we use a Group Key Agreement protocol to
create a new temporary network, then generate a new session key and use this
network to propagate it among all users belonging to the group wishing to
separate;

- we do not use GKA for the final new network cause it is not flexible enough
(in the case of new users or temporary isolated users of previous network) and 
not suitable for small devices;
